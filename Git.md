# summarizing:

## Git :
 * is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.

## Local Operations:
* Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. 

## Tracking Changes:
* Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

## Loss of Data:
* Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.

## States:
* Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

> ## Committed:
* Data is securely stored in a local database.

> ## Modified:
* File has been changed but not committed to the database.
