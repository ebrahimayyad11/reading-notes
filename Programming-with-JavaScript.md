## Learning to program with JavaScript involves: 

1. Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them. 
2. Learning the language itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.
3. Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today. 


## How javascript makes web pages more interactive:

1. ACCESS CONTEN: You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.
2. MODIFY CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. 
3. PROGRAM RULES: You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.
4. REACT TO EVENTS: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when: 

* A button is pressed.
* A button is pressed.
* A cursor hovers over an element.
* Information is added to a form.
* An interval of time has passed.
* A web page has finished loading.


## The ability of javascript in the browser:
1. Access the content of the page.
2. Modify the content of the page.
3. Program rules or instructions the browser can follow.
4. React to events triggered by the user or browser.

## what is script?
* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

## WRITING A SCRIPT
* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 

### The steps of writing a script:
1. DEFINE THE GOAL.
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT.
3. DESIGN THE SCRIPT.


## Rules for naming variables:
1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.  
3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript. 
4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases. 
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, fi rstName might be used to store a person's first name, l astNarne for their last name, and age for their age. 
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, f i rstName rather than fi rstnarne (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash). 

## Arrays
* An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

### valus in array
* Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

## (function-method-object) 
* complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines.
