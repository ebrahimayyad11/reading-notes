## comparison operators: evaluating conditions
1. ==  : is eqal to .
2. !=  : is not eqal to .
3. === : strict eqal to .
4. !== : strict not eqal to.
5. >   : greater than.
6. <   : less than.
7. >=  : greater than or equal to.
8. <=  : less than or equal to.


### Structuring comparsion operators
* (score >= pass)


## USING COMPARISON OPERATORS
* At the most basic level, you can evaluate two variables using a comparison operator to return a true or fal se value. 
* example: ((5 > 2) && (2 >= 3))


## loops
* loops check condition if it return true the code block will run then the condition will be checked again and if it still return true the code block will run again it repeats until the condition return false.

### there are three common types of loops:
1. for.
2. while.
3. do while.

### loop counters:
1. intialization : var i = 0;
2. condition : i < 10;
3. update : i++;

### using for loop
* A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array. 


### using while loop
* This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parentheses is true. That condition is a counter indicating that, as long as the variable i remains less than 10, the statements in the subsequent code block should run. 


### using do while loop
* The key difference between a while loop and a do while loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met.
